// The brightness variable in the lib is rather confusing. 
// The idea of a brightness is simple until you realize it's an independant variable from the pixel pointer array 
// Which is all fun and good. But wait. You want pixels of differing brightness levels? Well shit, this variable only stores one level for the whole string.
// Another interesting note, in the fn/method definition file of the lib, it mentions that the brightness level is a setup-time sloppy bitch
// (they admitt it's a bit lossy, particularly for large changes and low levels) because they did some 8x8 multiplication magic
// to ease the instruction sets on a cycle so the WS2811/WS2812 (the LED+driver chip) timings can play nice.
// This worries me a wee bit because I have a rather large batch of instructions from the halving process and I haven't even put in the colors or tach read.
// Maybe functional was not the way to go.
// I can eak out a large amount of performance by keeping static masks in global. Classic initialization+mem bloat as an instructions trade-off.
// A closure might be a boon as well for returns.
