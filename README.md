# NeoPixel-Playtime
Just a boy who wants to play with LED's

Just a bit tired of the dependency/scripting madness of web development. And I don't even do web development.

What?  
AdaFruit NeoPixel 60 LED/m  
*  3.5A @ 5V full-tilt
*  I only have a 1V @ 5V power supply. (But I made it so I can probably bump it up with some short work. A 2A regulator would be supah easy. Power is readily available, heat has nowhere to go though.)

Using Arduino Uno R3 to drive  
Just playing around with code. I'm undecided if I'm going to do multiple sketches or just revision one.

Maybe I should try a fun tach w/ 1 LED = 100 RPM. All LED's would give me a 6000 RPM range... I can't imagine the Jeep getting higher than that. I'd feel bad for it if it did. Poor thing.

## Fun Fact
The adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel lib currently has a Build | Failed tag on their git... Just a cheeky compile with the lads.
